# Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic video game that originated in the late 1970s and gained massive popularity in the late 90s when it was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones.

## Gameplay

1. The player controls a long, thin creature, a "snake", that roams around on a bordered plane.
2. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake.
3. The player controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, or right), and the snake's body follows.
4. The player cannot stop the snake's movement; it constantly moves in the direction of its head.
5. The objective of the game is to eat items (usually represented as dots or apples) by running into them with the head of the snake.
6. Each item eaten makes the snake longer.
7. The game ends when the snake runs into the screen border, or into its own body.

The goal is to eat as many items as possible before the game ends, with the score typically being a count of the items eaten. This game is known for its increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer and faster over time, requiring more careful control.
